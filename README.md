# ScratchTutorials
Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.

With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.


In this tutorial you can learn how to create simple games, animations and understand how a back-end of a program works.
